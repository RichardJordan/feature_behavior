## Installation

Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively,
replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git
if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add feature_behavior

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem
by executing:

    $ gem install feature_behavior

## Usage

TODO: Instructions to follow

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine,

run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`,
and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag
for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the
`.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
